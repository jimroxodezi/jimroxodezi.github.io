Hey there! I’m Jimrox Odezi.

Welcome to my blog! I’m a master’s student in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering. I have a keen interest in low-level programming (C and C++), computer networking, backend programming, distributed systems, telecom sysytems and engineering mathematics.

This is my little corner on the internet where I share everything I’m learning and geeking out about. I write the kind of posts I’d love to read myself, so if you’re into software engineering or just curious about what I’m up to, stick around.
