## I Love Software Engineering ðŸ˜Š

I want to learn to think right of computer programs--I want to be cunning software craftsman. I'm intrigued by computer software and I want to be grounded in it's historical context, and attune with it's futuristic perspective. I want to build great models of abstraction.

I'm not afraid of the computational complexity zoo, for these computational structures were 
pioneered by mere mortals like me. I want to have an intuitive appreciation for the simplicity
of the abstraction of these complex systems.

I will be thorough in my learning and have a strong grasp of the fundamentals and soar!I really hope to be a great software craftsman....and I think that's not too much of a thing!
