I really didn't like Nodejs or JavaScript as a programming language due to its seemingly difficult to understand programming constructs--and this
made me shy away from web programming especially front-end programming that makes heavy use of the JavaScript programming language. But with time,
I started giving myself to understand the language (JavaScript) and the runtime (Niodejs). This is true for understanding anything, innit?--getting to 
understand the basic building blocks and fundamental ideas that stack up to become the very intricate and often intitmidating-to-beginners systems.
It's a fact that if we give it time (and thorough learning), we can grok anything no matter how intricate it may seem.
