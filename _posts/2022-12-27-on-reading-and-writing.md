paper. As long as it consists solely of description it is pretty easy; but where reasoning
comes into play, to make a proper connection, a clearness & a moderate fluency, is to

Reading (and writing) can be  quite a hard thing, no matter how well formed your reading habit is. 

If you'll take time to read and learn to internalize the grammar and semantics of writings, that is, learn stuffs like context, eymology, meaning and formation of words, there's basically no article you can't grok no matter how intricate it may appear to be. You tend to be in the mind of the author of the article.

This means to be a successful reader, you must learn that art of reading.
